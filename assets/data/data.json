        "intro": "Mobile robots do not come with heavy computing power so the detection algorithm response time should be sufficient enough that the robots can make a decision fairly quickly. Multiple object recognition and localization for mobile robot navigation in a dynamic indoor environment are proposed in this study. The algorithm detects an object by combining deep features for recognition and local features for localization. For recognition of multiple objects, a CNN based Deep learning model that uses MobilenetV2 as a base network with a sigmoid classification layer is developed. The model generates a probability for each object in the image independently, which is used for localizing the recognized object in the image. ORB+SURF is used as a feature extractor to generate a bounding box for each object. ORB+SURF is compared with different feature detection and descriptor combination to evaluate its performance. The object detection algorithm is also integrated with ROS to evaluate the performance in a real-world scenario and in doing so the distance information is also extracted from the Laser distance sensor mounted on the top of Turtlebot.",
